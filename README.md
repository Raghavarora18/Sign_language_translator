# Sign Language Translator

## Overview

This project is an end-to-end **real-time Sign Language Translation system** designed to recognize hand gestures and translate them into textual representations. The system focuses on **alphabet-level and space-aware sign recognition**, with an emphasis on real-time usability and clean, production-ready structure.

The project is built using **YOLO-based object detection** for hand gesture recognition and supports **keyboard-assisted control** to improve robustness during live inference.
